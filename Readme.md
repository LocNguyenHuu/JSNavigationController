## <a name="usage"></a>Usage
If you're familiar with `UINavigationController` API, you won't be lost, it's quite the same.

### <a name="creatingNavigationBar"></a>Creating the navigation controller
Creating a navigation controller is easy, here is the constructor signature:

```swift
init(rootViewController: NSViewController, contentView: NSView, navigationBarView: NSView)
```
It takes 3 arguments:

1. `rootViewController`: the controller you want to be at the bottom of the navigation stack.
2. `contentView `: the view you want to be used as the container of pushed views.
3. `navigationBarView `: the view you want to be used as the container of pushed views in the navigation bar.

**_Note_**: `JSNavigationController` **does not hold references** to the views you pass as `contentView` and `navigationBarView`.

### <a name="pushingViewControllers"></a>Pushing view controllers
```swift
func push(viewController viewController: NSViewController, animated: Bool)
func push(viewController viewController: NSViewController, animation: AnimationBlock?)
func push(viewController viewController: NSViewController, contentAnimation: AnimationBlock?, navigationBarAnimation: AnimationBlock?)
```

**_Note_**: pushing a view controller that is already in the navigation stack will have no effect.

In order to push a view in the navigation bar as well, the pushed view controller must conform to the `JSNavigationBarViewControllerProvider` protocol, which is defined as follow:

```swift
public protocol JSNavigationBarViewControllerProvider: class {
	weak var navigationController: JSNavigationController? { get set }
	func navigationBarViewController() -> NSViewController
}
```

### <a name="poppingViewControllers"></a>Popping view controllers
#### • Popping to the previous view controller
```swift
func popViewController(animated animated: Bool)
func popViewController(animation animation: AnimationBlock?)
func popViewController(contentAnimation contentAnimation: AnimationBlock?, navigationBarAnimation: AnimationBlock?)
```
#### • Popping to the root view controller
```swift
func popToRootViewController(animated animated: Bool)
func popToRootViewController(animation animation: AnimationBlock?)
func popToRootViewController(contentAnimation contentAnimation: AnimationBlock?, navigationBarAnimation: AnimationBlock?)
```
#### • Popping to a specific view controller
```swift
func pop(toViewController viewController: NSViewController, animated: Bool)
func pop(toViewController viewController: NSViewController, animation: AnimationBlock?)
func pop(toViewController viewController: NSViewController, contentAnimation: AnimationBlock?, navigationBarAnimation: AnimationBlock?)
```
**_Note_**: do nothing if the specified view controller is not in the navigation stack or is the top view controller.

### <a name="customAnimations"></a>Custom animations
How does AnimationBlock works? Let's take a look at its declaration:

```swift
typealias AnimationBlock = (fromView: NSView?, toView: NSView?) -> (fromViewAnimations: [CAAnimation], toViewAnimations: [CAAnimation])
```
* `fromView`: it's the view currently on screen (**the view to hide**).
* `toView`: the view that will be on screen after the animation completed (**the view to show**).

The block must return a tuple which contains animations for corresponding views.

**_Note_**: at the end of animations, `fromView` is removed from its superview and all animations attached to its layer are also removed. It means that you can't have an animation where both `fromView` and `toView` are visible at the end.

#### Example
A simple crossfade animation:

```swift
let animation: AnimationBlock = { (_, _) in
	let fadeInAnimation = CABasicAnimation(keyPath: "opacity")
	fadeInAnimation.fromValue = 0.0
	fadeInAnimation.toValue = 1.0
	fadeInAnimation.duration = 0.25
	fadeInAnimation.timingFunction = CAMediaTimingFunction(name: kCAMediaTimingFunctionEaseOut)
	fadeInAnimation.fillMode = kCAFillModeForwards
	fadeInAnimation.removedOnCompletion = false

	let fadeOutAnimation = CABasicAnimation(keyPath: "opacity")
	fadeOutAnimation.fromValue = 1.0
	fadeOutAnimation.toValue = 0.0
	fadeOutAnimation.duration = 0.25
	fadeOutAnimation.timingFunction = CAMediaTimingFunction(name: kCAMediaTimingFunctionEaseOut)
	fadeOutAnimation.fillMode = kCAFillModeForwards
	fadeOutAnimation.removedOnCompletion = false

	return ([fadeOutAnimation], [fadeInAnimation])
}
```
